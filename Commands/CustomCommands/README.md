# CustomCommands
Uncomment line 47 in your config.php from
`// __DIR__ . '/CustomCommands',`
to
`__DIR__ . '/CustomCommands',`
to enable this folder.
You can then copy example commands from the Command folder.

**:exclamation: Important!**

DO NOT COPY THE ENTIRE COMMAND FOLDER CONTENT!! 

Some command files are duplicated and may interfere with each other.
